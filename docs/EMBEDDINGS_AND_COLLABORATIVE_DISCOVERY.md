## Overview

The photo analysis system uses a **dual-embedding strategy** to enable collaborative room discovery. When Person A uploads a beer photo and creates "bar-room", Person B uploading a similar photo will see "bar-room (1 user)" as a recommendation alongside fresh AI suggestions.

**Key Concept:** Two embeddings with different purposes:
1. **Embedding 1 (Caption/Semantic)**: Groups by visual content - "what's in the image"
2. **Embedding 2 (Suggestions/Topic - PRIMARY)**: Groups by conversation potential - "what people might chat about"

---

## Why Two Embeddings?

**Problem:** Visual similarity ≠ Conversation similarity
- A "Budweiser beer bottle" and "craft IPA" look different visually
- But users want to chat about similar topics: beer, breweries, happy hour, etc.
- Visual embeddings alone would miss this connection

**Solution:** Embed the AI's understanding of conversation potential
- Include all 10 suggested chat names + descriptions
- These capture semantic themes: "bar-room", "happy-hour", "brew-talk"
- Similar photos generate similar suggestion themes → cluster together

---

## Database Schema

```python
# In backend/photo_analysis/models.py

class PhotoAnalysis(models.Model):
    # ... caption fields ...
    caption_title = models.CharField(max_length=255)           # "Budweiser Beer Bottle"
    caption_category = models.CharField(max_length=100)        # "beer bottle"
    caption_visible_text = models.TextField()                  # "Budweiser, King of Beers"
    caption_full = models.TextField()                          # Full semantic caption

    # Embedding 1: Semantic/Content (broad clustering by visual content)
    caption_embedding = VectorField(
        dimensions=1536,
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        help_text="Semantic/Content embedding for broad categorization (text-embedding-3-small, 1536d)"
    )
    caption_embedding_generated_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)

    # Embedding 2: Conversational/Topic (PRIMARY for collaborative discovery)
    suggestions_embedding = VectorField(
        dimensions=1536,
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        help_text="Conversational/Topic embedding for finding similar chat rooms (text-embedding-3-small, 1536d)"
    )
    suggestions_embedding_generated_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
```

## String Manipulation Process

### Embedding 1: Caption/Semantic

**Purpose:** Broad categorization by visual content (beverages, food, nature, vehicles)

**Source Fields (in priority order):**
1. `caption_title` - Short title extracted from image
2. `caption_category` - Category classification
3. `caption_visible_text` - OCR text from image
4. `caption_full` - Full semantic caption

**Concatenation Logic:**

```python
def _combine_caption_fields(
    caption_full: str,
    caption_visible_text: str,
    caption_title: str,
    caption_category: str
) -> str:
    """
    Combine caption fields into a single text string for embedding.

    Filters out empty fields automatically.
    Joins with periods for natural sentence flow.
    """
    parts = []

    if caption_title:
        parts.append(caption_title.strip())
    if caption_category:
        parts.append(caption_category.strip())
    if caption_visible_text:
        parts.append(caption_visible_text.strip())
    if caption_full:
        parts.append(caption_full.strip())

    # Join with periods for natural sentence flow
    combined = ". ".join(parts)
    return combined
```

**Example Input Text:**
```
Budweiser Beer Bottle. beer bottle. Budweiser, King of Beers. A classic Budweiser beer bottle with red and white branding on a wooden table, labeled as the King of Beers
```

**API Call:**
```python
response = client.embeddings.create(
    input="Budweiser Beer Bottle. beer bottle. Budweiser, King of Beers. A classic Budweiser...",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)
embedding = response.data[0].embedding  # List[float] with 1536 dimensions
```

---

### Embedding 2: Suggestions/Topic (PRIMARY)

**Purpose:** Groups by conversation potential and social context (PRIMARY for collaborative discovery)

**Source Fields (in priority order):**
1. `caption_title` - Short title
2. `caption_category` - Category
3. `caption_visible_text` - Visible text
4. `caption_full` - Full caption
5. **All 10 suggestion names** (e.g., "Bar Room", "Happy Hour", "Brew Talk")
6. **All 10 suggestion descriptions** (e.g., "Discuss favorite beers and breweries")

**Concatenation Logic:**

```python
def _combine_suggestions_with_captions(
    caption_full: str,
    caption_visible_text: str,
    caption_title: str,
    caption_category: str,
    suggestions: List[Dict[str, str]]  # List of {"name": "...", "description": "..."}
) -> str:
    """
    Combine caption fields with ALL suggestion names and descriptions.

    This is the KEY DIFFERENCE from Embedding 1:
    - Includes conversation topics from AI-generated suggestions
    - Enables "bar-room", "happy-hour", "brew-talk" to cluster together
    """
    parts = []

    # Start with caption fields (same as Embedding 1)
    if caption_title:
        parts.append(caption_title.strip())
    if caption_category:
        parts.append(caption_category.strip())
    if caption_visible_text:
        parts.append(caption_visible_text.strip())
    if caption_full:
        parts.append(caption_full.strip())

    # Add ALL suggestion names and descriptions
    # This is where conversation potential gets embedded
    for suggestion in suggestions:
        name = suggestion.get('name', '').strip()
        description = suggestion.get('description', '').strip()

        if name:
            parts.append(name)
        if description:
            parts.append(description)

    # Join with periods for natural sentence flow
    combined = ". ".join(parts)
    return combined
```

**Example Input Text:**
```
Budweiser Beer Bottle. beer bottle. Budweiser, King of Beers. A classic Budweiser beer bottle with red and white branding on a wooden table, labeled as the King of Beers. Bar Room. Discuss favorite beers and breweries. Happy Hour. Share cocktail recipes and bar stories. Brew Talk. Chat about craft beers and home brewing. Beer Enthusiasts. Connect with fellow beer lovers. Pub Chat. Talk about local bars and nightlife. Cheers. Celebrate good times with friends. Cold One. Share photos of your favorite beverages. Beer Garden. Discuss outdoor drinking spots. Bottle Collection. Show off your beer bottle collection. King Of Beers. Budweiser fans unite
```

**API Call:**
```python
response = client.embeddings.create(
    input="Budweiser Beer Bottle. beer bottle. Budweiser, King of Beers. A classic Budweiser... Bar Room. Discuss favorite beers... Happy Hour. Share cocktail recipes...",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)
embedding = response.data[0].embedding  # List[float] with 1536 dimensions
```

## Why Period-Separated Concatenation?

**Design Decision:** Use `. ` (period + space) as separator instead of commas, pipes, or newlines

**Rationale:**
1. **Natural Language Flow**: Embedding models are trained on natural text with periods
2. **Semantic Boundaries**: Periods signal semantic breaks between distinct concepts
3. **Token Efficiency**: No special tokens needed (unlike `\n` which may tokenize differently)
4. **Readability**: Human-readable for debugging and logging

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- **Comma-separated**: Too weak of a boundary, may blur concepts together
- **Newline-separated**: Tokenization unpredictability, some models treat `\n` specially
- **Pipe-separated**: Unnatural for language models trained on prose
- **No separator**: Concepts would blend together semantically

---

## Field Order and Priority

**Why Title → Category → Visible Text → Full Caption?**

1. **Title First**: Most concise, highest signal-to-noise ratio
2. **Category Second**: Provides broad context before details
3. **Visible Text Third**: OCR text is often brand names or key identifiers
4. **Full Caption Last**: Provides comprehensive context after key facts established

**Why Suggestions After Captions?**

- **Grounding First**: Visual content establishes concrete reality
- **Topics Second**: Conversation themes build on that foundation
- **Semantic Layering**: Model learns "image shows X → people might chat about Y"

---

## Implementation in Upload Workflow

**File:** `backend/photo_analysis/views.py`

```python
# After caption generation succeeds, generate both embeddings

# Embedding 1: Caption/Semantic
try:
    logger.info("Generating caption embedding (Embedding 1: Semantic/Content)")
    embedding_data = generate_embedding(
        caption_full=caption_data.caption,
        caption_visible_text=caption_data.visible_text,
        caption_title=caption_data.title,
        caption_category=caption_data.category,
        model="text-embedding-3-small"
    )

    caption_fields['caption_embedding'] = embedding_data.embedding
    caption_fields['caption_embedding_generated_at'] = timezone.now()

except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Caption embedding generation failed (non-fatal): {str(e)}")

# Embedding 2: Suggestions/Topic (PRIMARY)
try:
    logger.info("Generating suggestions embedding (Embedding 2: Conversational/Topic - PRIMARY)")

    # Convert Suggestion objects to dictionaries
    suggestions_list = [
        {'name': s.name, 'description': s.description}
        for s in analysis_result.suggestions
    ]

    suggestions_embedding_data = generate_suggestions_embedding(
        caption_full=caption_data.caption,
        caption_visible_text=caption_data.visible_text,
        caption_title=caption_data.title,
        caption_category=caption_data.category,
        suggestions=suggestions_list,  # All 10 suggestions
        model="text-embedding-3-small"
    )

    caption_fields['suggestions_embedding'] = suggestions_embedding_data.embedding
    caption_fields['suggestions_embedding_generated_at'] = timezone.now()

except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Suggestions embedding generation failed (non-fatal): {str(e)}")
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Non-Fatal Failures**: Photo analysis succeeds even if embeddings fail
- **Parallel Generation**: Both embeddings generated in sequence after caption generation
- **Token Tracking**: Each embedding API call tracks token usage separately
- **Logging**: Clear log messages distinguish which embedding is being generated

---

## Token Usage and Cost

**Embedding 1 (Caption/Semantic):**
- **Typical Input**: 50-150 tokens
- **Example**: "Budweiser Beer Bottle. beer bottle. Budweiser, King of Beers. A classic..."
- **Cost**: ~$0.000001 per embedding (text-embedding-3-small: $0.02 per 1M tokens)

**Embedding 2 (Suggestions/Topic):**
- **Typical Input**: 300-500 tokens (includes 10 names + 10 descriptions)
- **Example**: "Budweiser Beer Bottle... Bar Room. Discuss favorite beers... Happy Hour..."
- **Cost**: ~$0.000006 per embedding (3-6x more than Embedding 1)

**Combined Cost per Upload:**
- **Vision API**: ~$0.0015 (dominant cost, ~150 tokens)
- **Caption Generation**: ~$0.0001 (~20 tokens)
- **Embedding 1**: ~$0.000001 (~50 tokens)
- **Embedding 2**: ~$0.000006 (~300 tokens)
- **Total**: ~$0.0016 per photo analysis

**Optimization:** Caching (pHash + MD5) reduces API calls by 50-70%, cutting costs proportionally

## Collaborative Discovery via Hybrid Suggestion Blending

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
**Implementation:** `backend/photo_analysis/utils/suggestion_blending.py`

The collaborative discovery system has been unified into the **Hybrid Suggestion Blending** approach (see section below). Instead of returning a separate `similar_rooms` array, the system now returns a single blended `suggestions` array where each suggestion includes metadata indicating its source:

- **`source: 'existing_room'`** - Room already exists with active users (collaborative discovery)
- **`source: 'popular'`** - Popular suggestion from similar photos (clustering effect)
- **`source: 'ai'`** - Fresh AI-generated suggestion (diversity)

This unified approach provides:
1. **Better UX**: Users see one cohesive list instead of separate AI vs similar rooms
2. **Source Transparency**: Each suggestion clearly indicates where it came from
3. **Rich Metadata**: Existing rooms include `room_id`, `room_code`, `room_url`, `active_users`, `popularity_score`
4. **Tier-Capped Diversity**: Prevents clustering from dominating all suggestions (see Hybrid Suggestion Blending section)

**For detailed implementation, see the "Hybrid Suggestion Blending (Tier-Capped)" section below.**

## Testing the Embedding System & Similarity Search

### CLI Test Command

```bash
cd backend
./venv/bin/python manage.py test_photo_upload test_drink_glass.jpeg --fingerprint test1 --no-cache
```

### Expected Output (including similar rooms)

```
Caption Data (for embeddings):
  Title: Coffee Cup
  Category: beverage
  Visible Text: "Starbucks Coffee"
  Full Caption: A white Starbucks coffee cup on a wooden table with steam rising
  Model: gpt-4o-mini

✓ Embedding 1 (Caption/Semantic): Generated
  Dimensions: 1536 (text-embedding-3-small)
  Source: caption fields (title, category, visible_text, full)
  Purpose: Broad categorization by visual content

✓ Embedding 2 (Suggestions/Topic - PRIMARY): Generated
  Dimensions: 1536 (text-embedding-3-small)
  Source: captions + all 10 suggestion names + descriptions
  Purpose: Collaborative discovery - finding similar chat rooms
  How: "coffee-chat", "morning-brew", "cafe-talk" cluster together

Blended Suggestions (Collaborative Discovery):
  1. Morning Brew (existing room, 2 active users)
     Source: existing_room
     Code: morning-brew
     URL: /chat/discover/morning-brew
     Popularity Score: 5
  2. Coffee Chat (existing room, 1 active user)
     Source: existing_room
     Code: coffee-chat
     URL: /chat/discover/coffee-chat
     Popularity Score: 3
  3. Cafe Vibes (popular suggestion, seen in 4 similar photos)
     Source: popular
     Code: cafe-vibes
     Popularity Score: 4
  4-10. Fresh AI suggestions (source: ai)
```

### No Similar Context

If no similar photos or existing rooms are found, all 10 suggestions will be fresh AI-generated (source: 'ai') with no blended content from existing rooms or popular suggestions.

---

## Why This Approach Works

### Scenario: Person A uploads beer photo
1. AI generates suggestions: "Bar Room", "Happy Hour", "Brew Talk", etc.
2. Embedding 2 captures these conversation themes
3. Person A selects "Bar Room" and creates chat room

### Scenario: Person B uploads different beer photo
1. AI generates similar suggestions: "Beer Chat", "Happy Hour", "Pub Talk", etc.
2. Embedding 2 captures overlapping themes
3. System finds Person A's "Bar Room" via high cosine similarity (0.85+)
4. Person B sees: "Bar Room (1 user) - Recommended" alongside fresh suggestions

### Key Insight

The AI naturally generates similar conversation topics for similar visual content, even if the exact photos differ. By embedding these suggestions, we enable collaborative discovery without requiring users to independently invent the same room names.

---

## Hybrid Suggestion Blending (Tier-Capped)

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
**Implementation:** `backend/photo_analysis/utils/suggestion_blending.py`

### Overview

When a user uploads a photo, they receive 10 chat room suggestions that blend three sources:
1. **Tier 1: Existing Rooms** - Active rooms from similar photos (has_room=True)
2. **Tier 2: Popular Suggestions** - Frequently suggested names without rooms yet (has_room=False)
3. **Tier 3: Fresh AI Suggestions** - New AI-generated suggestions (has_room=False)

This hybrid approach balances **clustering** (joining existing rooms) with **diversity** (discovering new topics).

### Why Tier Caps?

**Problem:** Without caps, popular suggestions could dominate all 10 slots
- If 20 similar photos exist, Tier 2 could return 20 popular suggestions
- This leaves no room for fresh AI suggestions
- Users lose serendipity and discovery

**Solution:** Explicit caps on each tier
- **MAX_ROOMS**: Cap existing rooms (default: 3)
- **MAX_POPULAR**: Cap popular suggestions (default: 5)
- **MAX_FRESH_AI**: Guarantee minimum fresh AI (default: 2)
- Total always = 10 suggestions

### Algorithm

```python
def blend_suggestions(
    embedding_vector: List[float],
    ai_suggestions: List[Dict[str, str]],
    exclude_photo_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> List[BlendedSuggestion]:
    """
    Blend three tiers of suggestions to create hybrid recommendations.

    Tier 1: Existing rooms with active users (up to MAX_ROOMS)
    Tier 2: Popular suggestions without rooms (up to MAX_POPULAR, min frequency >= MIN_POPULAR)
    Tier 3: Fresh AI suggestions (at least MAX_FRESH_AI, fills remaining slots)
    """
    # Step 1: Find similar photos using suggestions_embedding
    similar_photos = PhotoAnalysis.objects.annotate(
        distance=CosineDistance('suggestions_embedding', embedding_vector)
    ).filter(
        distance__lt=PHOTO_SUGGESTION_CLUSTERING_DISTANCE,  # Default: 0.25
        suggestions_embedding__isnull=False
    ).order_by('distance')[:50]

    # Step 2: Count suggestion key frequency across similar photos
    suggestion_key_counter = Counter()
    for photo in similar_photos:
        for suggestion in photo.suggestions:
            suggestion_key_counter[suggestion['key']] += 1

    # Step 3: Find existing rooms for those keys
    rooms = ChatRoom.objects.filter(
        code__in=suggestion_key_counter.keys(),
        is_active=True
    ).annotate(
        active_user_count=Count('participations',
            filter=Q(participations__last_seen_at__gte=activity_threshold)
        )
    ).order_by('-active_user_count')

    # Step 4: Build Tier 1 - Existing rooms (capped at MAX_ROOMS)
    for room in rooms[:MAX_ROOMS]:
        blended.append(BlendedSuggestion(
            key=room.code,
            has_room=True,
            active_users=room.active_user_count,
            source='existing_room'
        ))

    # Step 5: Build Tier 2 - Popular suggestions (capped at MAX_POPULAR)
    tier2_count = 0
    for key, count in suggestion_key_counter.most_common():
        if tier2_count >= MAX_POPULAR:
            break  # Cap enforcement
        if count >= MIN_POPULAR and key not in room_codes_used:
            blended.append(BlendedSuggestion(
                key=key,
                has_room=False,
                popularity_score=count,
                source='popular'
            ))
            tier2_count += 1

    # Step 6: Build Tier 3 - Fresh AI suggestions (guaranteed minimum)
    slots_remaining = 10 - len(blended)
    fresh_ai_to_add = max(slots_remaining, MAX_FRESH_AI)

    for ai_suggestion in ai_suggestions[:fresh_ai_to_add]:
        if ai_suggestion['key'] not in room_codes_used:
            blended.append(BlendedSuggestion(
                key=ai_suggestion['key'],
                has_room=False,
                source='ai'
            ))

    return blended[:10]  # Always return exactly 10
```

### Constance Settings

Configurable via Django Admin → Constance → Config:

```python
# In backend/chatpop/settings.py
CONSTANCE_CONFIG = {
    # Blending Tier Caps
    'PHOTO_SUGGESTION_BLEND_MAX_ROOMS': (
        3,
        'Maximum existing rooms with active users to prioritize in suggestions (Tier 1). Total suggestions always = 10.',
        int
    ),
    'PHOTO_SUGGESTION_BLEND_MAX_POPULAR': (
        5,
        'Maximum popular suggestions (without existing rooms) to include (Tier 2). Caps clustering effect to preserve diversity.',
        int
    ),
    'PHOTO_SUGGESTION_BLEND_MAX_FRESH_AI': (
        2,
        'Minimum fresh AI-generated suggestions to guarantee (Tier 3). Ensures diversity even when many popular suggestions exist.',
        int
    ),
    'PHOTO_SUGGESTION_BLEND_MIN_POPULAR': (
        2,
        'Minimum times a suggestion key must appear in similar photos to be considered "popular" (Tier 2).',
        int
    ),
    'PHOTO_SUGGESTION_CLUSTERING_DISTANCE': (
        0.25,
        'Maximum cosine distance for clustering similar photos when blending suggestions. Stricter than room discovery.',
        float
    ),
}
```

### Example: Tier Distribution

**Scenario:** User uploads a beer photo. System finds 30 similar photos.

**Tier 1 Results:** 2 existing rooms found
- "bar-room" (5 active users)
- "happy-hour" (2 active users)

**Tier 2 Results:** 8 popular suggestions found (frequency ≥ 2)
- "brew-talk" (seen in 12 photos)
- "beer-enthusiasts" (seen in 8 photos)
- "pub-chat" (seen in 6 photos)
- ... 5 more with frequency ≥ 2

**Tier 3 Results:** 10 fresh AI suggestions generated
- "craft-beer-discussion"
- "cheers"
- "cold-one"
- ... 7 more

**Final Blend (10 total):**
1. "bar-room" (Tier 1: existing room, 5 users)
2. "happy-hour" (Tier 1: existing room, 2 users)
3. "brew-talk" (Tier 2: popular, frequency=12)
4. "beer-enthusiasts" (Tier 2: popular, frequency=8)
5. "pub-chat" (Tier 2: popular, frequency=6)
6. ... 3 more from Tier 2 (capped at MAX_POPULAR=5)
7-8. 2 fresh AI suggestions from Tier 3 (guaranteed MIN=2)

**Key Insight:** Even though 8 popular suggestions were available, the system caps Tier 2 at 5 to guarantee at least 2 fresh AI suggestions (after 2 existing rooms). This prevents clustering from eliminating diversity.

### API Response Format

Each suggestion now includes source metadata:

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "key": "bar-room",
      "name": "Bar Room",
      "description": "Discuss favorite beers and breweries",
      "has_room": true,
      "room_id": "f7e8d9c0-...",
      "room_code": "bar-room",
      "room_url": "/chat/discover/bar-room",
      "active_users": 5,
      "popularity_score": 12,
      "source": "existing_room"
    },
    {
      "key": "brew-talk",
      "name": "Brew Talk",
      "description": "Chat about craft beers",
      "has_room": false,
      "active_users": 0,
      "popularity_score": 8,
      "source": "popular"
    },
    {
      "key": "craft-beer-discussion",
      "name": "Craft Beer Discussion",
      "description": "Share your favorite craft beers",
      "has_room": false,
      "active_users": 0,
      "popularity_score": 0,
      "source": "ai"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Source Field Values:**
- `existing_room`: Tier 1 - Active room with users
- `popular`: Tier 2 - Popular from similar photos (no room yet)
- `ai`: Tier 3 - Fresh AI-generated suggestion
