# Test Status Report - URL Migration to Username-Based Routing

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Migration:** Changed endpoints from `/api/chats/{code}/` to `/api/chats/{username}/{code}/`

## Summary

**Total Tests:** 346
**Passing:** 215 (62.1%)
**Failing:** 97 (28.0%)
**Errors:** 34 (9.8%)

## Successfully Migrated and Passing Tests

These test files were successfully updated with the new URL format and all tests pass:

### ✅ tests_host_first_join.py (10/10 passing)
- All tests for host-first join enforcement are working correctly
- Tests verified URLs like `/api/chats/HostUser/{code}/` work as expected

### ✅ Other Updated Test Files (12 total)
The following test files were successfully updated by the automated migration script:

1. `tests_chat_ban_enforcement.py`
2. `tests_username_flow_integration.py` (⚠️ has some failures - see below)
3. `tests_partial_cache_hits.py`
4. `tests_redis_cache.py`
5. `tests_user_blocking.py`
6. `tests_blocking_redirect.py`
7. `tests_security.py`
8. `tests_username_generation.py` (⚠️ has some errors - see below)
9. `tests_blocking.py`
10. `tests_profanity.py`
11. `tests_message_deletion.py`

## Failing/Error Tests

### ❌ tests_blocking_e2e (Module Load Error)
**Status:** ERROR - Module failed to load
**Cause:** Module import/configuration error, not related to URL migration

### ❌ tests_photo_room_creation (11 errors)
**Status:** ERROR on all tests
**Tests affected:**
- `test_cannot_create_room_from_similar_room_code`
- `test_create_new_room_from_ai_suggestion`
- `test_invalid_photo_analysis_id`
- `test_join_existing_room_from_ai_suggestion`
- `test_join_existing_room_from_similar_rooms`
- `test_missing_photo_analysis_id`
- `test_missing_room_code`
- `test_reject_invalid_room_code`
- `test_selection_tracking_overwrites_previous`
- `test_times_used_increments_on_selection`

**Presumed Cause:** These tests are for AI-generated photo rooms which use the `/discover/{code}/` URL pattern (not the username-based pattern). These tests were not updated by the migration script as they don't follow the manual room URL structure. However, the errors suggest there may be other issues beyond just URL formatting.

**Recommendation:** Check if these tests:
1. Need to use `/discover/` pattern instead of username pattern
2. Have dependency issues with photo analysis functionality
3. Need test data setup adjustments

### ❌ tests_username_flow_integration (5 errors)
**Status:** ERROR on rotation/security tests
**Tests affected:**
- `test_rotation_after_username_becomes_unavailable`
- `test_rotation_preserves_original_capitalization`
- `test_rotation_then_join_integration`
- `test_case_preserved_username_passes_security_check`
- `test_rejoining_user_bypasses_generation_check`

**Presumed Cause:** This file was in the list of "updated" files, but specific integration tests are failing. Possible causes:
1. Test setup creates chat rooms but doesn't properly format URLs with username
2. Username rotation logic may have edge cases not covered by the URL migration
3. Tests may use dynamic URL construction that wasn't caught by the regex patterns

**Recommendation:** Manually inspect these tests to verify URL construction matches the new pattern.

### ❌ tests_username_generation (1 error)
**Status:** ERROR on dice roll rotation test
**Tests affected:**
- `test_rotation_index_per_chat_independent`

**Presumed Cause:** Similar to username flow integration, this test likely involves URL construction that wasn't caught by the automated migration.

**Recommendation:** Manual review of URL construction in this test.

### ❌ tests_voice_messages (3 errors)
**Status:** ERROR on voice message tests
**Tests affected:**
- `test_complete_voice_message_flow`
- `test_upload_file_too_large`
- `test_upload_invalid_file_type`

**Presumed Cause:** Voice message upload endpoints use the chat URL structure. If tests construct URLs dynamically (e.g., using chat_room.get_absolute_url()), they may not be using the new username-based format.

**Recommendation:**
1. Check if voice upload endpoint URLs need manual updating
2. Verify if the tests use helper methods for URL construction that need updating
3. Check if there are fixture/factory issues creating test chat rooms

## Migration Script Details

### Automated URL Fixes Applied
The migration script (`/tmp/fix_test_urls_v2.py`) successfully applied these transformations:

**Pattern 1:** `f'/api/chats/{self.chat_room.code}/'` → `f'/api/chats/{username}/{self.chat_room.code}/'`

**Pattern 2:** `f'/api/chats/{variable.code}/'` → `f'/api/chats/{username}/{variable.code}/'`

**Pattern 3:** `'/api/chats/CHATCODE/'` → `'/api/chats/{username}/CHATCODE/'`

Where `{username}` was extracted from the test file's setUp method (typically `'HostUser'`).

### Known Limitations
The script did NOT update:
- AI-generated room URLs using `/discover/{code}/` pattern
- Dynamically constructed URLs using helper methods or model methods
- URLs built with string concatenation in test logic
- Reverse URL lookups using Django's `reverse()` function

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Fix tests_photo_room_creation:** Determine if these should use `/discover/` pattern or if there are deeper issues
2. **Fix tests_username_flow_integration:** Manually inspect and update URL construction
3. **Fix tests_voice_messages:** Update voice upload endpoint URLs

### Medium Priority
4. **Fix tests_username_generation:** Update dice roll rotation test URLs
5. **Fix tests_blocking_e2e:** Resolve module import error

### Low Priority
6. Run individual test files to isolate remaining failures
7. Consider creating a test utility function for constructing chat URLs consistently

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
./venv/bin/python manage.py test chats --noinput

# Run specific passing test file
./venv/bin/python manage.py test chats.tests.tests_host_first_join --noinput

# Run specific failing test file
./venv/bin/python manage.py test chats.tests.tests_photo_room_creation -v 2

# Get summary of failures
./venv/bin/python manage.py test chats --noinput 2>&1 | grep -E "^(FAIL|ERROR):"
```

## URL Pattern Reference

### Manual Rooms (Username-Based)
```
Old: /api/chats/{code}/
New: /api/chats/{username}/{code}/

Example: /api/chats/HostUser/ABC123/
```

### AI-Generated Rooms (Discover Pattern)
```
Format: /api/chats/discover/{code}/

Example: /api/chats/discover/XYZ789/
```

Note: AI rooms use `/discover/` prefix and don't require username in URL.
