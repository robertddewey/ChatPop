"""
Management command to clean up expired photo analysis records.

This command:
1. Finds all PhotoAnalysis records where expires_at < now()
2. Deletes the associated image files from S3 or local storage
3. Deletes the database records

Usage:
    ./manage.py cleanup_expired_photos [--dry-run] [--batch-size=100]

Options:
    --dry-run: Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
    --batch-size: Number of records to process at once (default: 100)
